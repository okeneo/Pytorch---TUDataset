# Preparing Pytorch TUDatasets for modelling
- Load Pytorch TUDatasets.  
- Parse each dataset by getting the node/edges, as well as the graph label of each graph in the dataset.
- Convert a graph from its TUDataset format to a graph TupleList representation.  

_Note: There are major components missing from this script, such as training and testing using these datasets. Unfortunately, I cannot provide these because that work should have been published by now and I do not own them._
