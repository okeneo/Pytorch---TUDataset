# Preparing Pytorch TUDatasets for modelling
Load Pytorch TUDatasets.  
Parse each dataset by getting the node/edges, as well as the graph label of each graph in the dataset.  
Lastly, we convert a graph from its TUDataset format to a graph TupleList representation.  

**Note: *There are major components missing from this script, such as training and testing using these datasets. Unfortunately, I cannot provide these because that work should have been published and I do not own them.* **
